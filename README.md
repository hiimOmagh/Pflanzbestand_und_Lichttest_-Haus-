# Pflanzbestand und Lichttest â€“ Haus

## Project goals

This Android sample demonstrates simple plant management combined with light testing. The main
screen lists example plants and measures ambient light to calculate PPFD and DLI, helping evaluate
indoor conditions for plant growth.

## Build and setup

The project uses the Gradle wrapper. From the repository root run:

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

This will download dependencies and produce the app's APK in `app/build/outputs/apk/`.

## Usage

1. Install the generated APK on an Android device or emulator that has a light sensor.
2. Open the app to view the list of sample plants.
3. Tap a plant to view its details.
4. Watch the main screen's live lux, PPFD, and DLI readings to test lighting conditions for your
   plants.

## Species PPFD targets

On first launch the app seeds the database with common species light requirements from
`app/src/main/assets/targets.json`. Each entry defines a `speciesKey` along with its acceptable
`ppfdMin` and `ppfdMax` values. To add or adjust species:

1. Edit `app/src/main/assets/targets.json` and add another object to the list.
2. Reinstall the app or clear its data so the database is recreated and picks up the changes.

## Background thread usage

`PlantRepository` performs blocking database operations. Use an
`ExecutorService` or similar mechanism to call its methods off the main thread:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executor.

execute(() ->{
PlantRepository repository = new PlantRepository(context);
List<Plant> plants = repository.getAllPlants();
// Update UI on the main thread after retrieving data.
});
```

## Architecture

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the planned module layout, fragment structure,
and resource naming conventions.
