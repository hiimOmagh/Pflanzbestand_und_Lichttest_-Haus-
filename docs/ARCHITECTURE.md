# Architecture

This document captures the current high-level structure of the app, the MVP relationships between
screens, and the data pipelines that feed Room and background work.

## Module layout
- `app` â€“ Android application module containing Activities, Fragments, presenters, Room database,
  background workers, and instrumentation tests.

## MVP overview

Each screen is implemented as a Fragment (or the hosting `MainActivity`) paired with a presenter that
owns the business logic. Presenters communicate exclusively with `PlantRepository`, which exposes
asynchronous APIs backed by Room DAOs.

    end

    end

    MainPresenterImpl --> PlantRepository
    PlantListPresenter --> PlantRepository
    LightMeasurementPresenter --> PlantRepository
    DiaryPresenter --> PlantRepository
    StatsPresenter --> PlantRepository
    PlantRepository --> PlantDatabase
```

Repository callbacks are marshalled to the main thread, allowing presenters to update their attached
views synchronously without leaking executors into the UI layer.

## Data flow diagrams

### Light measurement and calibration pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    LightSensor --> LightSensorHelper --> LightMeasurementPresenter
    Camera --> CameraLumaMonitor --> LightMeasurementPresenter
    LightMeasurementPresenter -->|updates| LightMeasurementFragment
    LightMeasurementPresenter -->|loads calibration| PlantRepository
    PlantRepository --> PlantCalibrationDao
    PlantRepository --> MeasurementDao
    LightMeasurementFragment -->|opens| CalibrationFragment
    CalibrationFragment --> LightSensorHelper
    CalibrationFragment -->|save factors| PlantRepository --> PlantCalibrationDao
```

The presenter smooths readings from both the ambient light sensor and the camera luma monitor, applies
per-plant calibration factors, and emits PPFD/DLI values to the fragment. The calibration fragment
lets the user persist ambient and camera factors, which are stored in the `PlantCalibration` Room
entity and fed back into future measurements.

### Import / export pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User --> ExportManager --> BulkReadDao
    BulkReadDao --> PlantDatabase
    ExportManager -->|writes ZIP| data.json
    data.json --> User
    User --> ImportManager --> ImportParsers
    ImportParsers --> PlantRepository
    PlantRepository --> PlantDatabase
```

`ExportManager` gathers plants, measurements, diary entries, reminders, calibrations, species targets,
and media paths via `BulkReadDao`, writes the chosen manifest format, and zips the result with copied
media files. `ImportManager` detects JSON or CSV manifests, streams them through parser helpers, and
persists the entities inside a Room transaction to ensure atomic imports.

## Background work and scheduling

Reminder notifications are routed through `ReminderScheduler`. On Android 12+ the scheduler delegates
future triggers to `ReminderWorkManager`, which configures unique `WorkManager` jobs that invoke
`ReminderWorker` when alarms should fire. On earlier API levels the scheduler falls back to
`AlarmManager`, keeping the WorkManager code path ready once WorkManager is available on the device.
Whenever reminders are created, updated, or cancelled the scheduler broadcasts a widget update so the
home-screen quick actions reflect the latest state.

## Calibration storage

Per-plant calibration data lives in the `PlantCalibration` entity with columns `plantId`,
`ambientFactor`, and `cameraFactor`. `PlantRepository` exposes `getPlantCalibration` and
`savePlantCalibration` helpers used by both `LightMeasurementPresenter` (to refresh factors when a
plant is selected) and `CalibrationFragment` (to persist user-entered values). Calibrations are
exported in both CSV (`PlantCalibrations` section) and JSON (`plantCalibrations` array) backups and are
restored during imports before any measurements are processed.

## Resource and code conventions

- Layout files follow `fragment_<feature>.xml` and `activity_<screen>.xml` naming.
- Strings, IDs, and drawables are prefixed with their feature area (e.g. `measurement_*`, `diary_*`).
- Java code adheres to the Android Open Source Project style guide; fragments end in `Fragment`,
  presenters end in `Presenter`, and DAO interfaces live alongside their entities.
- Use `TODO(name):` comments for follow-up work and keep indentation at 4 spaces with UTF-8 encoding.
